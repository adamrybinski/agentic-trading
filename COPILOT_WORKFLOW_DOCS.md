# Copilot-Triggered CI/CD Workflow Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the enhanced CI/CD system that responds to Copilot activity and provides intelligent issue management for the agentic-trading repository.

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. **Copilot Activity Detection**
The workflow automatically detects when Copilot has completed a task by monitoring:
- **Comment patterns**: Comments containing "Commit:" from copilot[bot]
- **Push events**: Direct pushes by copilot[bot]
- **Review comments**: PR review comments with completion indicators

### 2. **Smart Test Triggering**
- **Waits for completion**: Only runs tests after Copilot finishes (not during work)
- **30-second buffer**: Allows for multiple rapid commits to complete
- **Branch monitoring**: Listens to all branches, not just main/develop

### 3. **AI-Enhanced Issue Creation**
When tests fail, the system creates detailed issues with:
- **GitHub Models integration**: Uses AI to analyze failure patterns
- **Root cause analysis**: Automated diagnosis of common issues
- **Actionable recommendations**: Specific fix suggestions
- **Priority assessment**: Automatic severity and effort estimation

### 4. **Automatic Agent Triggering**
Failed tests automatically:
- Create GitHub issues assigned to **adamrybinski**
- Mention @copilot to trigger agent sessions
- Include structured failure analysis for faster resolution

### 5. **Branch Management**
Monitors all branches and:
- Detects branches without associated PRs
- Creates tracking issues for orphaned branches
- Suggests creating PRs for active development

## 🔧 Workflow Files

### Primary Workflows

1. **`.github/workflows/copilot-triggered-tests.yml`**
   - Main Copilot-responsive workflow
   - Handles test execution and failure management
   - Creates AI-enhanced issues

2. **`.github/workflows/ci-tests.yml`** (Enhanced)
   - Traditional CI/CD with improved issue creation
   - Issues assigned to adamrybinski with proper attribution

### Testing Utilities

3. **`test_copilot_workflow.py`**
   - Comprehensive test suite for workflow functionality
   - Validates trigger logic, AI integration, and issue creation
   - Simulates failure scenarios

## 🚀 Workflow Triggers

### Automatic Triggers

```yaml
# Triggered when Copilot completes work
on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
  pull_request_review_comment:
    types: [created]
  push:
    branches: ['**']  # All branches
```

### Trigger Conditions

The workflow runs when:
1. **Copilot comments** with completion indicator (contains "Commit:")
2. **Copilot pushes** code to any branch
3. **Manual execution** for testing purposes

### Wait Strategy

```yaml
# Prevents multiple overlapping runs
wait-for-copilot:
  needs: check-copilot-completion
  steps:
    - name: Wait for potential additional commits
      run: sleep 30
```

## 🔍 Test Execution

### Comprehensive Test Suite

The workflow runs:
- **Workflow functionality tests** (`test_workflow.py`)
- **Prolog generation tests** (`test_prolog_generation.py`)
- **Prolog analysis tests** (`test_prolog_analysis.py`)
- **GitHub Models integration tests**
- **File structure validation**
- **SWI-Prolog compatibility checks**

### Failure Simulation

For testing purposes, commits containing `test-failure-simulation` trigger intentional failures to validate the issue creation process.

## 🤖 AI-Enhanced Issue Creation

### GitHub Models Integration

When tests fail, the system:

1. **Collects failure context**:
   ```bash
   - Branch and commit information
   - Test output logs (last 50 lines)
   - Error messages and exit codes
   ```

2. **Generates AI analysis**:
   ```python
   prompt = f"""
   Analyze this CI/CD test failure and provide:
   1. Root cause analysis (2-3 sentences)
   2. Recommended fix (bullet points)
   3. Priority level (High/Medium/Low)
   4. Estimated effort (Quick fix/Medium/Complex)
   """
   ```

3. **Creates structured issue**:
   - AI-generated summary
   - Technical details
   - Actionable next steps
   - Automatic assignment to adamrybinski

### Issue Format

```markdown
## 🤖 AI-Enhanced Test Failure Report

### 📊 Failure Summary
[AI-generated analysis of root cause and recommendations]

### 📋 Technical Details
- Workflow: [workflow name]
- Branch: [branch name]
- Commit: [commit hash]
- Triggered by: [actor]

### 🎯 Next Steps
1. Review workflow logs
2. Check test artifacts
3. Fix failing tests
4. Push new commit (triggers re-test)

## 🌿 Branch Monitoring

### Orphaned Branch Detection

The workflow monitors all branches and creates issues for:
- Branches with commits but no associated PR
- Active development branches without proper tracking

### Auto-Issue Creation

```yaml
check-branch-pr-status:
  if: github.event_name == 'push'
  steps:
    - name: Check if branch has associated PR
      # Creates tracking issues for branches without PRs
```

### Branch Issue Format

```markdown
## 🌿 Branch Without Pull Request Detected

### 📋 Details
- Branch: `feature/new-feature`
- Latest Commit: abc123
- Pushed by: copilot[bot]

### 🎯 Action Required
Create a Pull Request for this branch

### 🤖 Copilot Integration
@copilot Please help create a proper Pull Request for this branch
```

## 🧪 Testing and Validation

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run the comprehensive test suite
python test_copilot_workflow.py

# Test specific scenarios
python test_copilot_workflow.py --scenario trigger-detection
python test_copilot_workflow.py --scenario ai-summary
python test_copilot_workflow.py --scenario failure-simulation
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite validates:
- ✅ Copilot completion detection
- ✅ Regular user comment filtering
- ✅ AI summary generation
- ✅ Branch monitoring logic
- ✅ Issue creation formatting
- ✅ Failure simulation triggers

```bash
🎯 Overall: 11/11 tests passed
🎉 All tests passed!
```

## 🔐 Security and Permissions
